Project Statement: As a Data Scientist, I have been tasked to find what makes a song popular based on a Spotify Dataset. 

Project Goal: To dig deep into the wonderful world music and find out what makes a song popular. Does the release date make a difference? Does the artist make a difference? 

We ran 4 different models (Decision Tree Model, Random Forest Model, XGBoost Model & Linear Regression) and each painted us a different story. Althought things like "danceability," "loudness," and "key," make a difference, it is really hard to say what makes a song popular since music changes daily. Furthermore, in the real world, things like marketing and having a large budget plays a big roll. 

Conclusion: If you are wondering how a song that you do not like hits #1 on the charts, you may want to look at who released it under what music label. 

Technical Team: Please open Mod-5-Top_50_Songs - FINAL  to view the python codes.
