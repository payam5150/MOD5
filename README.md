<b>Dataset:</b> Spotify Playlist-Clean_v2

<b>Project Statement:</b> As a Data Scientist, I have been tasked to research what makes a song popular based on a Spotify Dataset. 

<b>Project Goal:</b> To dig deep into the wonderful world of music and find out what makes a song popular. Does the release date make a difference? Does the artist make a difference? Does having a marketing team behind you make a difference? Does having a big budget make a differnce? 

We ran 4 different models <b>(Decision Tree Model, Random Forest Model, XGBoost Model & Linear Regression)</b> and each painted us a different story. Although things like "danceability," "loudness," and "key," make a difference, it is really hard to say what makes a song popular since music changes daily. Furthermore, in the real world, things like marketing and having a large budget plays a big roll. 

Conclusion: If you are wondering how a song that you do not like hits #1 on the charts, you may want to look into what music label released it and what type of budget they were working with.
